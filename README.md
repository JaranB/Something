# Group project in WebprosjektPRO101 at Westerdals/HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania

We had a task to make a website about the social options around our campus at Westerdals. We were required to follow guidelines regarding what resources we were allowed to use. At the website administrators can make posts about social places. Regular users will be able to read reviews, post and read comments, add places to favorites and more.
